Potator ported to the PocketSprite
----------------------------------

Potator is a Watara SuperVision emulator.

*NOTE*: THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION-QUALITY CODE AND NOT AN OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED EMULATOR! It misses the features that
the official PocketSprite ports of Gnuboy and SMSPlus emulators have. This emulator is released because 
it was fun to make. If you really really REALLY are interested in proper snapshot support etc, feel free
to ask for it.

At the moment, this emulator misses any snapshot support, meaning that every time
you power down the emulator, you loose all game state. The underlying emulator code also seems somewhat wonky,
as not all ROMs appear to work.

Potator seems to be written by Cal2 & Normmatt, and the version used here is modified by alekmaul. Potator
seems to be distributed as 'open-source' without specifying a particular license. The M6502 CPU core also
does not have a specific license, but seems to be open-source with the exception of commercial use. 
The PocketSprite modifications of this code fall under the WTFPL, as it seems to reflect the intentions 
of the original Potator authors best:
